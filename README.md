## JUPYTER
## Facility

- In LINUX, using terminal (UBUNTU)
- Clone the project with git clone (project page).
- Create a virtual environment (python -m venv env)
- Install the libraries of the requirements.txt (the ones used in the project)
{import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns} , inside the created virtual environment
- Install the jupyter inside the virtual environment (pip install jupyter)
- Write the jupyter notebook command to be able to enter the project

## COLLAB

- Create new collaborative project
- Write the code from google.colab import files
- Use the following command to upload the file to colab
#Load data to colab
load = files.upload()

- Import libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

# NOTE: WHEN THE COLLAB CLOSES, YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD THE FILE AGAIN SO THAT THE DATA IS RECOGNIZED BY THE ESTABLISHED COMMANDS.

- Another simpler way would be to upload the file on the left side there are 4 buttons (3 lines, magnifying glass, {x} and a folder) click on the folder button, Files will appear and click on upload file (button of a sheet with an arrow looking above), look for a project where I download

- Import libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Use

It is a small project that will allow us to see a purchase with the registered analysis of FROZEN SEA PRODUCTS.

## Contribution

We could improve the project by doing more data analysis such as what data to increase, what we should analyze and compare.
